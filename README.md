# Learning-Python
Just some of my basic codes done while learning py.

My first experiment is a fully operative tris game (Tic-Tac-Toe) in wich you can play against a friend
Or against a quite basic IA.

Done up to now:
    - configured IA.
    - replay possibility.
    - input like keyboard num-pad.

Still to do:
    - Implement 2 player game.
    - Improve the quality of the grid.
